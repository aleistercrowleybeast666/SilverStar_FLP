# KF6 field analysis and project paths

FLP remains 0.0.2; `.ssflp` remains v3 with one log per project. Decoder/project semantics stay
1.2, parameter schema stays 1.0 and wire formats are unchanged. Exact validation snapshots live
only in [VALIDATION.md](../VALIDATION.md).

## Outage policy and compatible parameters

Four GNSS groups independently track valid sample timestamps. NIS rejection does not expire
availability. Only a true gap strictly exceeding `gnss_reacquire_outage_ms` (default 300 ms)
authorizes return confirmation. A normal fused return clears eligibility without inflation.
Otherwise five hard rejects plus three consistent intervals permit factor-2 selective DPD'
inflation, at five rejected-epoch intervals, up to eight attempts. Three fused returns exit.
Repeated losses reset prior recovery attempts. Zero/duplicate/rollback timestamps cannot authorize
inflation; malformed group values do not refresh that group's validity clock.

Keep `gnss_velocity_std` and add `gnss_velocity_vertical_scale` (default 1): only U's measurement
sigma is multiplied after `max(receiver_sigma * 1.25, configured_floor)`. R squares this final
sigma. P0, Q, gravity, attitude, six-state dimension, Barometer pU observation/cross-covariance
vU correction and the source-quality/START gates remain unchanged.

Old `.ssflp` parameter identities are accepted only when they exactly match the prior KF6 schema.
Only the two new fields use explicit compatibility defaults; old required parameters remain
required. Diagnostics list the compatibility defaults. Old GNSS logs using the changed recovery
policy are approximate reproductions. Recorded values remain immutable and separate from What-if.

## Offline experiments

From the repository (or installed environment with its tools), run:

```powershell
.venv/Scripts/python.exe tools/kf6_field_analysis.py `
  --pair "D:/logs/SS0005.BIN" "D:/logs/Flight.ssdecoder" `
  --pair "D:/logs/SS0006.BIN" "D:/logs/Flight.ssdecoder" `
  --output "D:/analysis/field-run-01"
```

The output must be a new directory. Inputs are opened as exact hash-matched pairs, never rewritten;
source SHA-256 is checked before/after. Each log gets its own analysis JSON and the comparison
JSON lists independently estimated shifts. This creates no multi-log `.ssflp` format or runtime
FCCG/GSHC dependency. Development/test output must stay below this repository's `tests/`.

The report runs the current policy, an explicitly labeled old rejection-gate comparator, and
independent sweeps of outage threshold 160/200/250/300/500 ms, GNSS pU floor 2.5/3/4/5/6 m,
Barometer floor 1.5/2/3/5 m and velocity U sigma scale 1/1.25/1.5/2. The analysis keeps INITIAL_STATE
and P0 fixed; it does not claim to reproduce pre-START origin collection with different noise.
R changes still require the exact native uncertainty/source match. Missing native records produce
an explicit unavailable result instead of an invented fixed R. Normal What-if retains its
initialization evidence gate.

Velocity latency uses -500…+500 ms in 20 ms increments, then 5 ms refinement around the best coarse
candidate. Positive shift delays the velocity signal. Velocity and receiver variance are resampled
on the original GNSS sample grid in a common interior window. Position/Barometer timing is fixed;
there is no extrapolation or interpolation across source gaps. This is approximate offline
analysis; no firmware timestamp subtraction is applied. The diagnostic ranking uses EN/U p95 NIS
normalized by the actual group hard threshold plus hard-reject fractions. A minimum score alone
is not evidence of physical accuracy or an approved timing compensation.

Reports include per-group accepted/soft/hard/invalid counts, NIS max/percentiles and inflation
counts, final position/velocity, covariance peaks, exact-timestamp Recorded residuals and Pure INS
comparison. Residuals against recorded KF6 are not ground-truth errors. Stationary velocity RMSE
is absent unless a verified interval is explicitly supplied with `--stationary-us START END`.
The programmatic summary accepts a reference velocity series; absent reference data yields null,
not a claimed accuracy. Without multiple qualified real logs, retain conservative flight defaults.

## Default Project Root and result directories

File → 默认工程根目录... / Default Project Root... stores UTF-8 JSON in the application's
AppLocalDataLocation as `path_preferences.json`, schema_version 1. It is independent of `.ssflp`,
registry settings and source data. Invalid/missing JSON or a missing root falls back safely;
selecting a preference does not create the selected root.

New Project defaults to `<root>/<name>/<name>.ssflp`. Renaming follows until the first manual
path edit or Browse selection. A custom selected directory is used directly, without appending
another name directory. New directory creation occurs only after accepting the destination;
cancelling exact-pair import leaves no project file.

Import defaults to folder search. Its initial folder follows the current/pending project;
without a project it uses the default root, then the last successful import directory, then
an existing fallback. Manual exact-pair selection is still available.

Export defaults to `<project-directory>/Result_<log-stem>` (beside the log without a project).
Case-insensitive BIN/SSLOG suffixes are removed; Chinese, spaces and parentheses are retained,
Windows-illegal filename characters are replaced. Existing directories yield `_2`, `_3`, …
for automatic defaults. Manual destinations remain selected. Export refuses a nonempty destination
and preserves existing results. No automatic cleanup or overwrite is performed.
