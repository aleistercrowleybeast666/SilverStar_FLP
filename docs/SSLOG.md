# SSLOG0 support

The protected built-in `silverstar.flight_log.container.0_0` implements profile 0: a 64-byte
header followed by records containing a 24-byte common header, opaque payload, and 4-byte
CRC-32/IEEE. It has no knowledge of IMU/KF fields, units, instances, channels or algorithms.
Each CRC-valid record becomes a `RawRecordFrame` containing type/version, declared payload
length, sequence, timestamp, validity flags, raw bytes, source offset and CRC validity.

Production opening combines this container only with an exact matched `.ssdecoder` 1.1 and
selects each payload layout by `(record_type, record_version)`. The historical fixed parser is
kept for frozen internal fixtures but is not registered and is never a GUI/CLI/project fallback.

CRC failure or an unexpected byte sequence causes a scan for the next byte-aligned `FLG1` sync.
Already decoded records remain available. A final incomplete header, payload, or CRC is marked as
a truncated tail and ignored. CRC-valid unknown record types and unknown versions are advanced by
their declared payload length and counted in diagnostics. The dynamic parser retains their raw
bytes and labels the result partial, allowing a newer log to remain inspectable without guessing a
layout.

Container version, container-plugin API version, decoder-package schema, Record Version and
firmware version are independent. Record IDs are never reused and a layout for an existing
type/version pair cannot be duplicated inside a catalog.

Every production log also contains the fixed 64-byte `DECODER_PROFILE_DESCRIPTOR` bootstrap
Record. The container exposes it as opaque bytes; matching code validates the package/container
version and three 128-bit hash prefixes before dynamic payload parsing. A missing/conflicting/
nonmatching Descriptor rejects the open.
